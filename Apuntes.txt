I got this error when I set up a local repository first. Then went to github and created a new repository. Then I ran

git remote add origin <repository url>
When I tried to push/pull, I got the same fatal: unrelated_histories error. Here is how I fixed it:
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
git merge origin origin/master
... add and commit here...
git push origin master
